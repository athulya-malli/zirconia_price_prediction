Outcome: Carat is the most dominant factor in deciding the price of the gem. Higher the carat, higher the price of the gem.

Business decision: Cubic zirconia is an inexpensive alternative to diamond. If the company can design jewelry with higher carat cubic zirconia gem can bring about higher profit.
